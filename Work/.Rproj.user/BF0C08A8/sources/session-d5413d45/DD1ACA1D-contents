# Max Diff Implementation:

## Design

Since a complete block design is not possible, it is advised to adopt an incomplete block design.

An incomplete balanced block design (Youden design) can be created from a Latin Square Design which is a balanced block design.

## Data Analysis  

-   After transforming the best and the worst in each choice set to the original item numbers, the best minus worst (B-W) for each item is calculated and then for each respondent we will have 'n' new B-W variables, one for each item.

-   Then the average B-W scores is calculated by dividing the totals of B-W scores by the number of respondents and the frequency that each attribute appears in the design of the choice sets.

-   Another way to compare attribute importance is to derive ratio scores by taking the square root after dividing the total best (B) scores by the total worst (W) scores for each person (adding 0.5 to each W avoids dividing by zero). The resulting coefficient measures the choice probability compared to the most important item benchmark of 100 per cent (Auger et al., 2007; Flynn et al., 2007; Lee et al., 2008; Marley and Louviere, 2005). The square root of (B/W) for all attributes (sqrt(B/W)) is scaled by a factor such that the most important attribute with the highest sqrt(B/W) becomes 100. All attributes can then be compared to each other by their relative sqrt(B/W) ratio. The result is interpreted as X per cent (e.g. 60 per cent) as likely to be chosen best as the most important.
