It MUST have a carburetted engine! Also MUST have a manual transmission.

I parked a 2014 Challenger to drive a 1971 Chevy C10 and I honestly dont see myself e ver replacing that truck. Or even significantly modifying it. 250cid I6 runs beautifully, sips fuel, dream to work on. 3 on the Tree manual is more fun than 320hp ever was. Love the comfy benxh seat, soft ride, cheap 235/75r15 tires, styling, the lack of tech is amazing. I am done with modern cars!

If I do buy another vehicle it will be from tbe 1930s, 40s, or 50s.","2024-05-13 16:42:40","691687"
