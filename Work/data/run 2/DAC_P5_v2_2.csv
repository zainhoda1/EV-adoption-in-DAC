Look - Electric cars cost way more per mile to drive than a comparable gas vehicle.  Throw in the fact that mass-adoption of electric vehicles is going to wipe out most electric grids because they can’t take the drain.

They cannot be parked indoors because they can burst into flames.  They have to be handled carefully after an accident because they can burst into flames and often do.  They require thousands of tons of materials be mined out looking for Lithium.  Just because the supply chain isn’t within your purview doesn’t make it clean.  

This administration has tried to build public charging facilities to no avail after spending millions to build a handfull of facilities.

Electric cars are difficult and expensive to maintain and taking one off the beaten path where this expertise resides can lead to long-distance towing problems.

I’ll do a plug in Hybrid - but I will never do full electric.","2024-07-09 02:36:53","846167"
