Any vehicle I will so much as look the window sticker over on MUST have a carburetted engine AND a manual transmission. My grampa's 1971 Chevy C10 is going to be my forever daily and if I do buy another car it will be from the 1950s, 40s, or 30s. It will, like my C10, have 3 on the Tree and a simple carb-and-points engine.

You can thank Stellantis for this. My 2014 Challenger was so unapologetically awful it made me swear off ever owning a modern car again. They're built like absolute garbage, they ride even worse, they're ridiculously expensive to maintain, insure, incessantly annoy everyone inside them, are a clusterfuck to work on, have nervous dispositions particularly in inclement weather, and dont even do particularly well on gas(my 53 year old Chevy does 1mpg better than my 10 year old Challenger did!). Visibility is awful, the interiors are cramped and uncomfortable, the dashboards speak volumes yet say nothing, they rip control out of your hands whever they want, you cannot trust them to obey your inputs....blech. Enough of that. I reject it and embrace vintage simplicity.

Suffice it to say BEVs are a non starter for me. ","2024-07-03 14:00:42","201227"
